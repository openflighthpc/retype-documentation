This documentation will describe the process of setting up a cluster with all the capabilities shown in the other parts of the documentation. This will not explain the process, only list the necessary steps.

This is also **not** a guide, simply a example of an installation process that may be of use to those setting up a cluster. Several things are specific to this cluster:

- The cluster has 3 nodes.
- Every node on the cluster has an operating system installed, specifically Centos 8.
- Every node is on the network 10.50.0.0
