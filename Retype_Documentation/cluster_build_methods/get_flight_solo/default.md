This section contains pages which explain how to get Flight Solo, for multiple platforms. The main way that Flight Solo can be obtained is by importing it as a file but it is also available on the AWS Marketplace. You can learn more about creating an instance from a Marketplace image on the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launch-marketplace-console.html), or as part of a description of the cluster creation process on our docs [here](/cluster_build_methods/multinode_cluster/make_login_node/).


!!!
If you are trying to create a cluster, start by looking at the most relevant cluster type for you such as [multinode](/cluster_build_methods/multinode_cluster/) or [standalone](/cluster_build_methods/standalone_cluster/), if necessary you will be linked here.
