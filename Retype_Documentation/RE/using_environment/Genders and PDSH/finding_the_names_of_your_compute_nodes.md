An OpenFlight Compute research environment may contain any number of compute nodes depending on your research environment size. The hostnames of compute nodes usually follow a sequential order (e.g. node01, node02, node03â€¦ node10). OpenFlight Compute automatically creates a list of compute node names and uses them to populate a genders group called nodes. This genders file can be found at `/opt/flight/etc/genders`.

Users can find the names of their compute nodes by using the `nodeattr` command; e.g.

- `nodeattr -s nodes`
    - shows a space-separated list of current compute node hostnames
- `nodeattr -c nodes`
    - shows a comma-separated list of current compute node hostnames

- `nodeattr -n nodes`
    - shows a new-line-separated list of current compute node hostnames

The login node hostname for Flight Compute research environments launched using default templates is always `gateway1`.
