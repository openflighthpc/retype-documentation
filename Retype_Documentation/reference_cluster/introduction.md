This documentation will describe the process of setting up a cluster with all the capabilities shown in the other parts of the documentation.

This is also **not** a guide, simply a description of the installation process that may be of use to those setting up a cluster. Several things are specific to this cluster:

- The cluster is already set up with 1 head node and 2 compute nodes. 
- The cluster already has an operating system installed, specifically Centos 7.
- Every node is on the network 10.50.0.0
- The nodes are named: chead1, cnode01 and cnode02.
