This documentation will describe the process of setting up a cluster with all the capabilities shown in the other parts of the documentation.

Bear in mind that this cluster already has an operating system (Centos 7) and 3 nodes (1 head node and 2 compute nodes).

This is also **not** a guide, simply a description of the installation process that may be of use to those setting up a cluster.
