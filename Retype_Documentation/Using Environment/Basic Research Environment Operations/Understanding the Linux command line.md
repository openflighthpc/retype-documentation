Almost all usage of the Alces Flight system takes place via the Linux command line. For unfamiliar users here is a brief description of it.

```bash
[flight@chead1 (ivan1) folder]$ echo Hello World!
Hello World!
```

- `flight` is the name of the user.
- `chead1` is the node the user is currently on.
- `(ivan1)` is the name of the host machine ?
- `folder` is the directory the user is currently in.
- `$` indicates whether the user is a root user or normal user (root users see a `#`)
- `echo Hello World!` is a command that prints out "Hello World!". This is where commands you type will go.

```bash
[username@node (host_machine) folder]$ command
```

If some things that you see here are missing from your command line, you may not have activated Flight Direct (see next page).
