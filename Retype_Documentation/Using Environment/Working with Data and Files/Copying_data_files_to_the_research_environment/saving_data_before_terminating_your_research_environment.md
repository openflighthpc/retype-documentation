label: Saving data before terminating your research environment
---

When youâ€™ve finished working with your OpenFlight Flight Compute research environment, you can select to terminate it in the console for your Cloud service. This will stop any running instances and wipe the shared storage area before returning the block storage volumes back to the provider. Before you shutdown your research environment, users must ensure that they store their data safely in a persistent service, using one of the methods described in this documentation. When you next launch a Flight Compute research environment, you can restore your data from the storage service to begin processing again.
