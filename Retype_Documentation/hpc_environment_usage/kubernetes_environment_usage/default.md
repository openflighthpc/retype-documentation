[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.[^1] Describing how exactly to use it is out of scope for this documentation, and unnecessary since Kubernetes have [their own documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). However, creating a Kubernetes cluster is covered by this documentation, in the [cluster build method section](/cluster_build_methods/).
