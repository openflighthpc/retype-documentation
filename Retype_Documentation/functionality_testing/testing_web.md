Web Suite offers a more graphical way to use a cluster. There is a step by step guide of every feature in web suite, illustrated with images in the [Web Suite documentation](/hpc_environment_usage/flight_web_suite/landing_page/). If any of those steps do not function as shown by the documentation, then web suite may not be functioning.
