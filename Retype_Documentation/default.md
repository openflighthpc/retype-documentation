# Welcome to the OpenFlightHPC Build Knowledgebase!

This site contains the documentation for the OpenFlightHPC project. It contains tips and tools for streamlining the building and management of a HPC research environments. While the documentation will mainly focus on the OpenFlightHPC Research Environment workflow there will be notes and tips to customising the process for varying workflows.

## Documentation Goal

The purpose of this documentation is to provide understandable guidance to delivering the OpenFlightHPC Research Environment. This includes deploying resources on a given platform and installing the relevant software.

_Environment Delivery_ is the installation of software for the user experience on the research environment. This usually involves some sort of resource management/queuing system and application installation.

!!!
It is recommended to read through all of the documentation before starting to design the HPC platform to understand the scope and considerations.
