label: What is Flight User Suite?
---

The Flight User Suite is a collection of environment tools that provide users with easy and intuitive ways to manage the software and desktop sessions in a research environment. The purpose of these tools is to get researchers started with HPC as quickly as possible without needing to worry about their environment, leaving them to do what they do best - research!

The tools are non-intrusive to the research environment, defaulting to a "deactivated" state. Leaving admins and users free to configure and utilise their systems how they want.

Flight User Suite is made up of the following tools:

- Runway: Flight Runway provides a self-contained Ruby environment and an entrypoint for accessing the other flight tools
- Env: Flight Env provides access to, and management of, various software managers to ensure access to a wide variety of HPC applications
- Desktop: Flight Desktop provides an intuitive tool for launching VNC-ready virtual desktops of many different desktop environments (gnome, xterm, kde, etc)
- Starter: Flight Starter provides profile scripts for integrating the user suite into the shell environment
- Job: Flight Job Manager allows you to create and manage customized job scripts from predefined templates, launch jobs and monitor their activity.

## Installing Flight User Suite


The OpenFlight project packages tools as both RPMs and debs that are hosted in package repositories which can be quickly installed with a couple of commands. 



### Adding the OpenFlight Package Repositories


+++ CentOS 7

- Install the OpenFlight release RPM:

`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum install https://repo.openflighthpc.org/pub/centos/7/openflighthpc-release-latest.noarch.rpm`

- Rebuild the yum cache:

`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum makecache`

!!!
Some tools require packages available in the EPEL repository, this can be installed with `yum install epel-release`
!!!

+++ CentOS 8

- Install the OpenFlight release RPM:

`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo dnf install https://repo.openflighthpc.org/openflight/centos/8/x86_64/openflighthpc-release-3-1.noarch.rpm`

- Rebuild the yum cache:

`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo dnf makecache`

!!!
Some tools require packages available in the EPEL repository, this can be installed with ``yum install epel-release``. Additionally the PowerTools repository is needed, this can be enabled with ``yum config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools``
!!!

+++ Ubuntu 18.04

- Import the public signature for OpenFlight:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://repo.openflighthpc.org/openflighthpc-archive-key.asc`

- Install the OpenFlight repository:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://repo.openflighthpc.org/openflight/ubuntu stable main"`

- Update the apt cache:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-get update`

+++ Ubuntu 20.04

- Import the public signature for OpenFlight:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://repo.openflighthpc.org/openflighthpc-archive-key.asc`

- Install the OpenFlight repository:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://repo.openflighthpc.org/openflight/ubuntu stable main"`

- Update the apt cache:

`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-get update`

+++


Now the OpenFlight repositories are installed. There are 3 repositories available - production (enabled by default), dev (providing development releases of tools) and vault (access to old, unsupported versions and retired tools).


## Installation Method 1: Quick


The quickest and simplest way to get up and running with the user suite is to simply install the group package for the tools. This will ensure that compatible versions of all the tools are installed.

+++ CentOS 7
- Install the user suite RPM::
`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum install flight-user-suite`

+++ CentOS 8
- Install the user suite RPM::
`[flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo dnf install flight-user-suite`

+++ Ubuntu 18.04
- Install the user suite deb::
`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-user-suite`

+++ Ubuntu 20.04
- Install the user suite deb::
`flight@gateway1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-user-suite`

+++


!!!
After installation, either reboot your system or logout and back in again to expose the ``flight`` command to the shell
!!!

## Installation Method 2: Slightly Less Quick


Each tool in the user suite is also available through the repositories and can be installed one at a time.

            [flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum install flight-env

        - Install Flight Desktop RPM::

            [flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum install flight-desktop

        - Install Flight Starter RPM::

            [flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo yum install flight-starter
+++ CentOS 8
        - Install the Flight Runway RPM::

            [flight@gateway1 ~]$ sudo dnf install flight-runway

+++ Ubuntu 18.04
        - Install Flight Runway deb::

            flight@gatewat1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-runway

        - Install Flight Env deb::

            flight@gatewat1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-env

        - Install Flight Desktop deb::

            flight@gatewat1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-desktop

        - Install Flight Starter deb::

        - Install Flight Runway deb::

            flight@gatewat1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-runway

        - Install Flight Env deb::

            flight@gatewat1:~$ sudo apt-get install flight-env
